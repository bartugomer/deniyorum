# Integer to Roman Converter

Hi there! This is my first Python project where I tried to convert integers into Roman numerals.

## What it does

- Takes a number you type and shows its Roman numeral.
- Handles numbers up to 3999.
- Uses basic Python, so itâ€™s easy to understand for beginners like me.

## Example
Input: 1987
Output: MCMLXXXVII

## Why I made this
I wanted to practice Python and learn about string manipulation and loops. Still learning, so feedback is welcome!


```bash
python deneme.py
